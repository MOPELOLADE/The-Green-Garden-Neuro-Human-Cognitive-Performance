# The-Green-Garden-Neuro-Human-Cognitive-Performance
The Green Garden Neuro Initiative explore lifestyle choices influence human cognitive performance, concerns around mental health, aging, and the effects of modern habits, it examined the impact of diet, sleep, stress, and exercise on brain function. It reveals how shifts in daily routines can shape memory, focus, and overall cognitive resilience.

# Project Objective
This dashboard aims to explore the relationship between cognitive performance and various lifestyle and demographic factors, including diet type, sleep duration, memory test frequency, gender, and stress-related aging patterns. The analysis seeks to understand how these variables interact to influence cognitive health and performance across different age groups.

In 2024, the Green Garden Neuro Initiative set out to explore how lifestyle choices influence human cognitive performance. With increasing concerns around mental health, aging, and the effects of modern habits, this study examined the impact of diet, sleep, stress, and exercise on brain function. Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization, the project reveals how subtle shifts in daily routines can significantly shape memory, focus, and overall cognitive resilience.

# Datasets Used
i.	User Demographics: Gender, age, and unique user IDs.

ii.	Diet Information: Categorized into Non-Vegetarian, Vegetarian, and Vegan.

iii.	Sleep Duration: Sleep patterns tracked in hours.

iv.	Memory Test Scores: Quantitative memory test outcomes.

v.	Exercise Frequency: Low, Medium, and High engagement in cognitive exercises.

vi.	Stress Levels: Self-reported stress levels impacting aging.

vii.	Daily Screen Time: Hours spent daily in front of screens.

# Key Insights
1. Diet & Sleep Duration: Non-vegetarians report longer sleep durations on average compared to vegetarians and vegans.

2. Exercise Frequency & Memory Scores: Medium and low exercise frequencies show similar positive correlations with memory test scores, outperforming high frequency.

3. Gender-based Memory Test Performance: Males slightly outperform females and other genders in memory tests; however, females lead in overall cognitive function scores.

4. Stress-related Aging: Peak aging effects due to stress are most pronounced between ages 28–37.

5. Recall-based Diet Evaluation: Non-vegetarian diets show a significantly higher recall score compared to vegetarian and vegan options.

# Final Observations
1. Moderate levels of cognitive exercise appear more effective than high-frequency training.

2.Non-vegetarian diets are linked to better recall and sleep metrics.

3. Females exhibit the highest cumulative cognitive function despite lower memory test scores.

4. Age plays a role in stress-related cognitive aging, with performance dropping after age 57.

# Final Recommendation
Final Recommendation
	To optimize cognitive health:

	Encourage a balanced (non-vegetarian inclusive) diet, especially for memory retention and sleep regulation.

	Maintain medium cognitive exercise frequency for best results.

	Implement targeted stress-reduction programs for individuals aged 28–37.

	Tailor interventions by gender, considering observed cognitive strengths and needs
